# Spyfall

Simple implementation of the popular game, designed to run locally on an Android phone using NodeJS with [Termux](https://termux.com).

Not meant to be a serious project. Implemented it because the online version is not very reliable. Only supports one game at a time.

## Getting Started

* Install Termux.
* Clone this repo.
* Install NPM packages.
* Get your IP address using ```ifconfig```.
* Run the server using ```npm start```.
* Connect to your own server locally using ```http://localhost:3000``` and inform other players to connect to ```http://<ip-address>:3000```.
